# indivProjectDABootCamp
Individual project for Data Analysis Bootcamp
This poroject shows around 9,000 apps that are available on Google Plays. I developed an statistic analysis in Python using simple and multiple linear regression to identify the correlation between my dependent variable, number of installs, and my independent variables.
In addition I made some graphs in Tableau to show which Apps are more in demands for downloading.
